    "Description": "In \"MonitorWindowModel.cs\", _graphWindowTicks is defined as:\n_graphWindowTicks =\n                from tick in _tickerData\n                where tick.TimeStamp >= DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(-5) &&\n                      tick.Symbol == \"AAPL\"\n                select tick; // return last 5 minutes worth of ticks for AAPL */\nÂ \nWith my understanding of CLINQ, this doesn't accomplish what I would expect. This ContinuousCollection continues to grow, regardless of elapsed time window. This is a very valuable capability and I would be very interested in knowing how to efficiently achieve the behavior found in the code comment.",
