    "Description": "This issue is currently showing up in the stock monitor demo and I have had little luck troubleshooting it. After about 9 or so (varies) changes to the source collection, continuous aggregates on that source stop firing notifications. The Weak Collection Changed Event Handler (WCCH) works fine and continues firing over and over without fail... however, that doesn't seem to propogate to the continuous aggregation method, because after X changes, it stops firing.",

      "Message": "Looks like this is a weak reference problem. Apparently I didn't have proper back references from the continuous value to the AVA that supplies the values...without this, the AVA gets collected and the weak handler checks the Target property, sees a null, and then removes the dead link from its multicast delegate.",
