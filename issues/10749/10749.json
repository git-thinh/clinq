    "Description": "I'm getting lots of errors when I get the dll from here, this is because the dll is on .net 3.5.  I tried getting the source code and putting it to .net 4.5.1, but that didn't work because the source code is older code.\n\nWhat I would propose is making a .net 4.5.1 dll, or updateing the source code (probably a better idea).\n\nThanks!!",
