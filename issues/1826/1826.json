    "Description": "In the current (unchecked) version of the source code, the aggregate monitors are only listening to collection changed events. They need to be modified to work more like the view adapters for continuous collections where they monitor the property changed events of all items contained within those collections. This will allow the following required usage scenario:\n \n- Create a sample observable collection of customers with at least a property called \"Age\"\n- add some dummy customers\n- write a continuous sum query as follows:\n      ContinuousValue<int> ageSum = allCustomers.ContinuousSum<int>(c => c.Age);\n- add some more dummy customers\n- change the value of the Age property of an existing customer\n- inspect the ageSum variable - it should now reflect the new, updated total sum of customer ages after modifying the existing customer age in the previous step.\n \nContinuous Aggregates will not be considered working until this use case scenario is met.",
