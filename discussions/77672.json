Would it be a good idea to mark &quot;XmlIgnore&quot; these public properties? This is what I did in my local copy. But wanted to know if there is any specific design reason why &quot;Dispatcher&quot; is kept as a public property instead of protected. I can see that we might want to &quot;Suppress Property Changed&quot; on a particular reactive object in some places.</p>\r\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>",
