We are using this in a .NET 4.0 project, so we ended up making the necessary source changes ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>For the System.Action issue, we changed the Curry.tt file so that it didn't generate as many variations of the System.Action delegates. I think that was the only thing we had to do to get it compiling under .NET 4.0.</p>\r\n<p>We've made a couple other tweaks here and there too. I'd prefer not to do so, but there hasn't been a lot of response from the project contributors so far. I'm hoping they are still keeping an eye on this project. If not, maybe the community could pick it up.</p>\r\n<p>- Nathan</p>",
