Then, RebuildAll re-adds everything in _outer. It does not clear _outerReferenceTracker first. The end result is that every item has a reference count of 2.</p>\r\n<p>An unrelated problem is in RemoveOuter, where there's the line:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List&lt;OuterEntry&gt; outersMatchingKey = _keyToOuterLookup[outerEntry.Key];</p>\r\n<p>It appears to me that _keyToOuterLookup is not being updated when an outer item's key changes. I encountered this when I changed the key of an outer item, and later Removed that outer item. RemoveOuter tries to find the key in _keyToOuterLookup, it's not\r\n there, and an exception is thrown.</p>\r\n<p>Even if someone's code doesn't encounter this exception, the fact that items have an extra reference count and key changes are not tracked leads to _outerReferenceTracker and _keyToOuterLookup containing no-longer-used information.</p>\r\n",
