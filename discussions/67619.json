When items are added the ListBox showes the correct sorted items.</p>\r\n<p>If i extend the query with a Select() and Distinct() the sort order dont update anymore. But i still see newly added items.</p>\r\n<p>If i apply the CLINQ-Query to the ItemsSource of my ListBox again the sort order is restored. Seems like i have to recall that method if something changes manually. That means if my collection is changed AND if any item in my collection fires NotifyPropertyChanged. That also means that i have to update the PropertyChanged-Handlers in my Collection...</p>\r\n<p>It would be very cool if CLINQ could also refresh the sort-order automatically in filtering queries.</p>\r\n<p>Lector</p>",
