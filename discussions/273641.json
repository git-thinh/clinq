Where should a veteran C# .NET LINQ developer begin as a C&#43;&#43;/CLI CLINQ newbie?</p>\r\n<p>Briefly, I've got some classes in a C&#43;&#43;/CLI library that are exposing some IEnumerable&lt;&gt; results given a Dictionary&lt;&gt; backing field. I would like to ask a series of questions about that dictionary exposed through the enumerations. It seems CLINQ\r\n a strong viable approach to accomplishing this task?</p>\r\n<p>Where might I find some documentation? Or I just downloaded the source itself as well. Or for some tutorials? Throughout Codeplex?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks...</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Michael</p>\r\n",
