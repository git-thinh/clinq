If the Sort-Property-Key for one item is changing this Collection dont move it to the right Position. Instead it removes the Item from the Collection and is adding it again with 2 Collection-Changed-Events. Because of that my ListBox is always loosing its SelectedIndex even if the sortorder isnt really changing.</p>\r\n<p>Are you planning to fix this strange behaviour in the future?</p>",
