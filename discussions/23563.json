The general paradigm with a database is a user-requested pull or push in response to some action. CLINQ was built to handle the scenario where data is streaming into your application in the background asynchronously and potentially quite rapidly. People don't normally use database applications in this manner.<br /><br />That said, there is nothing preventing you from polling your database on a timer and then filling a ContinuousCollection with query results that can then be continuously filtered/ordered/grouped by CLINQ.<br />",
