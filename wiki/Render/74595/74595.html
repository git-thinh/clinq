<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Sample Usage Scenarios</h1>
When should you use CLINQ? <br />The short answer is : <b><i>anytime you wish to declaratively define a result set that is dynamically and continuously fed from a source list.</i></b><br /><br />The following are a few situations that provide a more concrete example of where CLINQ truly adds value.<br />
<h2>Financial Order Book</h2>In this usage scenario, your application is receiving a constant flood of market data ticks from some external source. <br />Rather than writing code to listen for changes to market data in a background thread and then figure out how to <br />pump all that data to the foreground thread, you can simply define a query against your singleton market data object<br /><b>tickerSource.AllTicks</b> and the ContinousCollection and CLINQ will take care of everything else. Changes that occur in the CLINQ<br />adapter chain pipeline are propagated on the Dispatcher thread, making them visible to the WPF data binder.<br /><br /><pre>
    var ticks = from tick in tickerSource.AllTicks
                    where tick.Symbol == &quot;AAPL&quot; &amp;&amp; 
                              tick.Price &gt; 100 &amp;&amp;
                              tick.Price &lt; 120
                    select tick;
    orderBook.DataContext = ticks; // WPF data binding
</pre><br /><br />
<h2>Network Message Monitor</h2>In this scenario, an application is gathering events from multiple sources and placing them in an object called <b>AllEvents</b>. The sample<br />query below would enable an application to &#39;sit back&#39; and listen, dynamically and continuously maintaining a result set that only<br />consists of network events that are considered critical.<br /><br /><pre>
    var criticalAlerts = from msg in eventLog.AllEvents
        where msg.Priority == MessagePriority.Critical
        orderby msg.EventTimeStamp desc
        select msg;
</pre><br />
<h2>Gaming (especially strategy / board games)</h2>In this scenario, the player is in a 3D universe piloting their space ship. You might have Windows Workflow Foundation code that handles the<br />artificial intelligence of enemies. Wouldn&#39;t it be so much easier than writing background thread polling code to detect nearby enemies if you could<br />just define a collection called <b>enemiesNearby</b> and then just define an event handler that allows you to inject your AI logic when enemies come<br />in and out of radar range?<br /><br /><pre>
    var enemiesNearby = 
      from gameObject in sharedState.AllGameObjects
      where gameObject.ObjectType == GameObjects.NPC &amp;&amp;
      gameObject.3DDistance(self) &lt;= self.RadarRange // 3DDistance could be an extension method!
      select gameObject;
    
    enemiesNearby.CollectionChanged += 
      new NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(enemiesNearby_Changed); // respond to newly detected threats!
</pre><br />
<h2>Administration / BI Console</h2>In this sample scenario, you have an application that is monitoring KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for a Business Intelligence workbench.<br />This application has a section of it&#39;s GUI dedicated to monitoring the failing KPIs throughout an organization. The following query shows how<br />you could define a single query to monitor all failing KPIs that can then be immediately bound to the WPF or WinForms GUI:<br /><br /><pre>
   var needsAttention = from kpi in biSystem.KPIList
                                  where kpi.Status == KpiStatus.RedRange // KPI is failing, needs attention
                                  select kpi;
